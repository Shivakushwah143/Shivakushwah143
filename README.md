# Hi, I’m Shiva 👋

### Full-Stack & DevOps Engineer | End-to-End Development | Applied AI Integration

I design and ship production-grade systems from scratch — architecture to deployment.

I work across the complete development lifecycle:
- Product thinking
- Backend architecture
- Frontend systems
- Infrastructure & DevOps
- AI integration
- Production deployment

I care less about tech debates and more about building reliable systems that people love using.

---

# 🚀 What I Deliver

- End-to-end product ownership (Architecture → Development → Deployment)
- Production-grade APIs (Validation, Auth, Rate Limiting, Structured Errors)
- Secure cloud deployments (AWS EC2, Nginx, SSL, CI/CD)
- Real-time systems (WebSockets, Redis, Kafka)
- AI-powered integrations (LangChain, Vector Databases, AI workflows)
- Scalable backend architecture (Event-driven, horizontal-ready systems)

---

# 🏗 Production Engineering Experience

- Deployed backend systems on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 24.04)
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- SSL via Let's Encrypt (auto-renew enabled)
- PM2 process management
- Domain & DNS mapping
- Dev / Production environment isolation
- CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
- HTTPS-secured APIs behind reverse proxy
- Clean production-grade folder structure

All systems are deployed with real-world configuration — not just local demos.

---

# 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- Clean architecture over shortcuts
- Explicit API contracts
- Strong TypeScript typing (strict mode mindset)
- Predictable error handling
- Security-first backend design
- Performance-aware implementation
- Ownership mentality — I build what I deploy
